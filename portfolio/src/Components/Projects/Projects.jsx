                            Ceratosaurus was a theropod dinosaur in the Late Jurassic, around 150 million years ago. This genus was first described in 1884 by American
                            paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh based on a nearly complete skeleton discovered in Garden Park, Colorado, in rocks belonging to the 
                            Morrison Formation. In 2000 and 2006, a partial specimen from the Lourinh達 Formation of Portugal was described, providing evidence for the 
                            presence of the genus outside of North America. Ceratosaurus was a predator with deep jaws supporting long, blade-like teeth. It had a
                            prominent, ridge-like horn on the midline of the snout and a pair of horns over the eyes. The forelimbs were very short but remained fully 
                            functional, with four-fingered hands.
